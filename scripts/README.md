## My scripts
These could be executed directly from shell, since this directory is added to `$PATH`. Most of the scripts can display help message `some_script -h` or `some_script --help` which provides more detailed information and use cases.

-   `start_jupyter.sh`: Start jupyter lab.
-   `add_toc.sh`: Customised `gh-md-toc` (see below). Although, it automatically appends TOC, removes autogenerated files and changes author name, but it still requires to put these lines at the top of markdown file:

    ```
    <!--TS-->   # make letters of lowercase
    <!--TE-->   # make letters of lowercase
    ```
    
-   `create_venv.sh`: Create a virtual environment and associated ipykernel.
-   `print_utils.sh`: This script provides printing utilities, therefore should be sourced

    ```
    # Oneliner for the scripts in the same directory
    source "$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null && pwd )/print_utils.sh"
    
    # For the scripts in other places (replace __CONFIG_HOME__)
    source __CONFIG_HOME__/scipts/print_utils.sh
    ```

## External scripts

-   `gh-md-toc`: Easy TOC creation for GitHub README.md. Usage:
    1.  Put these lines at the top of markdown file
    
        ```
        <!--TS-->   # make letters of lowercase
        <!--TE-->   # make letters of lowercase
        ```
        
    2.  Run from terminal:
    
        ```
        gh-md-toc --insert __FILE_NAME__    # To automatically append it

        gh-md-toc __FILE_NAME__             # Requires copy/paste
        ```
